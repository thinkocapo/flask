# sentry-demos/flask

## Summary:
To show how Sentry works in an example web app that uses Flask
- how to integrate the Sentry SDK into Flask (https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/flask/)
- trigger an error that gets sent as Event to Sentry.io Platform
- `app.py` has multiple endpoints for showing different ways that errors are handled
- Sentry Release cycle covered in `Makefile`

## Initial Setup & Run
1. `pip install -r ./requirements.txt`
2. Configure Sentry with your `DSN key` in app.py
3. Configure sentry-cli (is for creating Sentry releases) with your `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` in Makefile or set as environment variable. Do the same for `SENTRY_ORG` and `SENTRY_PROJECT`
4. Check your Github repo is integrated into your Sentry organization.
5. run `make`, which will use `sentry-cli` to create Sentry release and associatae commits, and run the Flask application
```
make deploy
```
